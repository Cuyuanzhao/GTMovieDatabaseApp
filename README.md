# GTMovieDatabaseApp
Purpose of the Project
Analyze, specify, design, implement, document and demonstrate an online
system for buying movie tickets at GTMovie.com. You are required to use the
classical methodology for database development. The system should be
implemented using a relational DBMS that supports standard SQL queries. Class
administrators will provide you with information about how to access a collegemanaged
MySQL server in order to implement your database and the application.
The professors must approve any other alternative implementations.
